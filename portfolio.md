### _MUSA 8000_ Practicum

During my Practicum project, my team and I worked with the City of El Paso Capital Improvements Department to construct a latent bus ridership demand model and an interactive app. This app enabled them to reconfigure their local bus network to better integrate with the newly constructed Sun Metro bus rapid transit system.

### _MUSA 6110_ Java Script Programming for Planners and Designers

For the final project in this course, I built a dashboard displaying housing and land use characteristics of the Fishtown neighborhood, imagining the Fishtown Neighbors Association  Zoning Committee as the user. By swapping between the Zoning, Building Height, and Commerce overlays, Zoning Committee members can gain relevant parcel level information, helping to facilitate meeting dialogue.

#### San Francisco Parking Demand Prediction

This assignment examines 5 weeks of parking meter interactions in core San Francisco with the aim of creating a fictional phone app. Parkers could use this app to find where there are free spots, and be charged a dynamic price based on the blockâ€™s expected occupancy for any given time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.

### _CPLN 6750_ Land Use and Environmental Modeling
#### Urban Growth Modeling in Delaware County, PA

This assignment analyzes the change in land cover for Delaware County, PA, in order to predict land cover in 2030, to help guide local land use planning. We take into consideration distance to highways, SEPTA train stations, current land use, and spatial lag to development, using a logistic regression to form our final model.

#### Philadelphia Sport Field Site Suitability Poster

This poster addresses the lack of sports fields for Philadelphia high school students by attempting to locate areas that would be suitable to develop for this purpose, comparing levels of need based on proximity to existing fields and proximity to high schools.

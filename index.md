 I am student in the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design. The MUSA program teaches leading-edge data science skills in the context of public sector decision making, from machine learning predictive modeling to spatial web application development. Furthermore, I am taking domain specific coursework in economic development, public finance, sustainable transportation, and energy policy. 
 
 I love Philadelphia and am a huge believer in its future. I grew up in Delco along the Media/Wawa line and currently live in the Fishtown neighborhood. Exploring the city by bicycle or SEPTA and mapping my routes on Strava is one of my favorite activities. Seeing all the legacy infrastructure and cultural diversity, my mental map of the city is quite strong, but there is always more to explore. 
 
  Apart from school, I keep busy playing League of Legends with my friends on Discord, playing disc golf at [Sedgley Woods](https://www.sedgleywoods.com/), or playing [bike polo](https://linktr.ee/phillybikepolo).

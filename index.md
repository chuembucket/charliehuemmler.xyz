👋 Hello, I'm Charlie Huemmler, a recent graduate of Master of Urban Spatial Analytics from the University of Pennsylvania. As a member of Generation Z, my career is driven by a commitment to advancing environmental justice in Philadelphia.

🌍 Public Sector Open-Source Advocate
I firmly believe that the public sector's adoption of open-source software is pivotal in addressing the intertwined challenges of climate change and social inequality. With expertise in open-source data science, GIS, and cloud computing acquired during my Urban Spatial Analytics program, I am equipped to leverage these tools for collaborative and innovative solutions.

🌆 Urban Planner
I am genuinely passionate about cities – the tapestry of spaces, communities, and possibilities. As an urban planner, I thrive on the interplay of ideas that shape urban landscapes. My specific domain knowledge in public transit, energy systems, and urban economic development allows me to envision and implement strategies that contribute to the sustainable growth and vitality of cities.

🏙️ Public Transit and Cycling Advocate
Beyond theory, I actively engage with Philadelphia's urbanism. Car-free and frequently commuting by bike or SEPTA, I intimately understand the nuances of urban mobility. This firsthand experience positions me to address the challenges and opportunities inherent in creating sustainable urban environments.

🏆 You can find me in Philadelphia playing disc golf at [Sedgley Woods](https://www.sedgleywoods.com/), pick-up with [Philly Bike Polo](https://linktr.ee/phillybikepolo), or esports at [The Block](https://nerdstreet.com/venues/localhost-in-philly). 
  
⛲ Let's Connect!
I'm enthusiastic about connecting with fellow changemakers, urban enthusiasts, and sustainability advocates. If you share my passion for cultivating a greener and more equitable Philadelphia, let's collaborate and explore ways to make our city thrive.

üëã Hello, I'm Charlie Huemmler, a recent Master of Urban Spatial Analytics graduate from the University of Pennsylvania. As a member of Generation Z, my career is driven by a commitment to advancing environmental justice in Philadelphia and its metropolitan region.

üåç **Open-Source Software for the Public Sector**
I firmly believe that the public sector's adoption of open-source software is crucial in addressing the intersecting challenges of climate change and social inequality. With expertise in open-source data science, GIS, and cloud computing acquired during my Urban Spatial Analytics program, I am equipped to leverage these tools for collaborative and innovative solutions.

üåÜ **Regional Lens to Planning**
Having grown up in Delaware County, and now living in Philadelphia, I have a strong understanding of the metropolitan region and the economic and cultural forces that tie the urban, suburban, and rural areas together. My specific domain knowledge in public transportation, energy systems, and economic development allows me to envision and implement strategies that contribute to the sustainable growth and vitality of cities and their regions.

üèô **Public Transit and Cycling Advocate**
I am a proud member of Philadelphia's urbanist advocacy community. I live car-free and travel the city by bike or SEPTA, so I intimately understand the nuances of urban mobility here. Philly already has strong urbanism, with its gridded street network and extensive electrified passenger rail service, and with more investment in these strengths I know it has potential to be a global leader in environmental justice. 

‚õ≤ **Let's Connect!**
I'm all about connecting with fellow changemakers, urbanists, and sustainability advocates. If you share my passion for cultivating a greener and more equitable Philadelphia, let's collaborate and explore ways to make our city thrive.
 
üèÜ You can find me in Philadelphia playing disc golf at [Sedgley Woods](https://www.sedgleywoods.com/), pick-up with [Philly Bike Polo](https://linktr.ee/phillybikepolo), esports at [The Block](https://nerdstreet.com/venues/localhost-in-philly), or riding my bike with [Wednesday Night Rides](https://wednightrides.org/).

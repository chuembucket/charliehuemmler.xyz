üëã Hello, I'm Charlie Huemmler, a recent graduate of Master of Urban Spatial Analytics from the University of Pennsylvania. As a member of Generation Z, I'm dedicated to pursuing a mission of environmental justice in Philadelphia throughout my career. I was born and raised in the suburbs, along the Media/Wawa regional rail line, and have lived in Philadelphia since Fall 2021.


üåç Public Sector Open-Source Software
I believe that the public sector‚Äôs adoption of open-source software is crucial to solving the intersecting crisis of climate change and social inequality. Open-source tools fosters collaboration, innovation, and accessibility, essential elements in addressing the pressing issues of our time. My degree in Urban Spatial Analytics gives me the open-source data science, GIS, and cloud computing skills to do precisely this. 


üèôÔ∏è Public Transit and Cycling Advocate
I am an advocate for Philadelphia's urbanism. I don't own a car, and I'm often found exploring the city on my trusty bike or on SEPTA. My firsthand experience navigating Philly gives me unique insights into the challenges and opportunities for sustainable urban development.


‚õ≤Let's Connect!
I'm always eager to connect with fellow changemakers, urban enthusiasts, and sustainability advocates. If you share my passion for creating a greener, more equitable Philadelphia, let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to make our city thrive.

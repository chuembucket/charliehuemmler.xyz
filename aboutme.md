## [About Me](/aboutme.md)

 I am currently in the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design, focusing on economic  development and sustainable transportation. The skills I am learning are designed to modernize the data capabilities of any public or non-profit institution. I love Philadelphia and am a strong advocate of public transit and micro-mobility infrastructure.

Since moving to Philadelphia in Fall 2021, I have been an active member of the urbanist advocacy community. I quickly got involved with [5th Square](https://www.5thsq.org/), the [Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia](https://bicyclecoalition.org/), and [Wednesday Night Rides](https://wednightrides.org/), using the mapping skills I learned in undergrad for social media posts and to do analysis for other volunteers. Through these organizations I have learned much about the city, its infrastructure and politics, and want to use this knowledge in making Philadelphia a biking and transit paradise.

As a Masters student, I was the Student Council representative for the MUSA program and I started the social bike ride club at the Weitzman School of Design.

Last spring, I led a Wednesday Night Ride and was joined by mayoral candidate Rebecca Rhynhart.

Recently, I have been active with the newly formed [Philly Bike Action!](https://bikeaction.org/), where I lead the coding team, manage the Discord server, and organize District 5 meetings. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi!

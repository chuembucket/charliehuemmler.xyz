Since moving to Philadelphia in Fall 2021, I have been an active member of the urbanist advocacy community in the city. I quickly got involved with 5th Square, the Bicycle Coalition, and Wednesday Night Rides, using the mapping skills I learned in undergrad for social media posts and analysis. Through these organizations I learn much about the city, its infrastructure and politics, becoming a part of the effort in making Philadelphia a biking and transit paradise.

This bicycle advocacy continued as a Masters student, I was the Student Council representative for the MUSA program and I started the social bike ride club.

Last spring, I led a Wednesday Night Ride, and was joined by mayoral candidate Rebbecaa Rhynhart.

Recently, I have been active with the newly formed Philly Bike Action!, where I manage the Discord server and coding team, and lead District 5 meetings.
